👋 Hi, I'm Aneela Bashir, a passionate developer with approximately 6 years of experience, primarily focusing on backend development.

👀 I have an insatiable curiosity for all things backend-related and am always eager to dive into new technologies and concepts.

🌱 Currently, I'm deepening my knowledge in Node.js and actively working on implementing it in various projects.

💞️ I'm open to collaboration on Node.js and JavaScript-related projects. I'm a firm believer in the power of teamwork to create exceptional solutions.

💞️ I'm particularly interested in architectural discussions, as I believe that well-thought-out architecture is the foundation of robust and scalable software systems.
